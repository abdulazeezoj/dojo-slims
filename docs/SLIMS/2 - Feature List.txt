NOT DOING:

1. Job Board/Placement Matching - Students get placements through existing SIWES Unit process; not our problem
2. Video Call Supervision - Supervisors prefer asynchronous reviews; adds unnecessary complexity
3. Social Features/Student Forums - Scope creep; doesn't solve core pain points
4. Offline Support - Platform requires internet connection; offline adds excessive complexity
5. Integrated Diagram Drawing Tools - Students use AutoCAD/Visio externally; integration unnecessary
6. Automated Activity Suggestions - Would encourage inauthentic entries; students should write genuine experiences
7. Payment/Invoice System - SIWES is free program; no transactions needed
