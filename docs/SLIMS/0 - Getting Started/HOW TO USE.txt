SOLO PRODUCT TEMPLATE

Lightweight template for solo builders and side projects.

---

WHEN TO USE THIS:

✓ Side projects and experiments
✓ Internal tools (you're the user)
✓ Solo builder testing ideas quickly
✓ MVPs where you know the problem well

DON'T USE THIS FOR:

✗ Products for other people (use full template)
✗ B2B SaaS with paying customers (use full template)
✗ Anything requiring investor validation (use full template)

---

WORKFLOW (5 STEPS):

1. Product Idea - What and why
2. Quick Research - 1-2 conversations, validate assumptions
3. Feature List - What to build
4. Database Schema - Data structure
5. System Architecture - Tech design

Total time: ~3-5 days before coding

---

WHAT'S DIFFERENT FROM FULL TEMPLATE:

Removed:
- User Journey Map (skip to implementation)
- User Flows (work them out while coding)
- Wireframes (just code directly)
- Validation Notes (no formal user testing)
- Detailed research docs (just quick notes)

Kept:
- Product Idea (know what you're building)
- Quick Research (validate assumptions)
- Feature List (scope MVP with user stories)
- Database Schema (design data)
- System Architecture (tech decisions)

---

VALIDATION:

After Step 2: Decide GO/NO-GO based on quick research
Then: Build fast, iterate based on usage

---

USAGE:

1. Copy this folder for each product
2. Fill steps 1-5 (3-5 days)
3. Start coding
4. Learn from real usage
5. Iterate

---

PRINCIPLE:

Move fast, but don't skip thinking.
Quick research > No research.
Documentation serves the builder, not the other way around.
