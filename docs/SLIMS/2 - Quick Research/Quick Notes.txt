CONVERSATION #1:
Person: SIWES Student, Computer Engineering, ABU
Date: January 20, 2026

What they do now:
Collects SIWES intro letter and logbook from school, takes intro letter to placement organization for signing, returns for processing, then proceeds to placement organization for 24-week training. Makes daily entries Monday through Saturday in physical logbook. Seeks out industry supervisor weekly for signature. Occasionally gets phone calls from school supervisor but mostly no communication during training period. Returns to campus with completed logbook at end.

Pain points:
- Constantly worried about losing the logbook - "If I lose this after 15 weeks of work, I'd have to restart everything"
- Industry supervisor travels frequently, so sometimes waits 3-4 days to get weekly signature
- Hand cramps from writing same format every day for 144+ entries
- Made spelling mistakes in week 3 that now look messy with corrections
- School supervisor called once in 12 weeks, has no idea if I'm doing well or not
- No feedback on whether my entries are good enough until the very end

Would they use this?
Yes, if it's not complicated. Main concerns are internet access at workplace and learning new system, but being able to edit entries freely and not losing work are huge benefits. Would love to see supervisor feedback during training instead of waiting until end.

Key quote:
"I'm always paranoid about the logbook. Last year a student's logbook got soaked in rain and he had to redo 10 weeks of entries. Digital backup would give me peace of mind."

CONVERSATION #2:
Person: School Supervisor, Faculty of Engineering, ABU
Date: January 22, 2026

What they do now:
Supervises 20 students per SIWES session spread across Lagos, Kaduna, Kano, Abuja. Expects students to call if problems arise but many don't. Manages to visit maybe 2-3 organizations per session due to travel budget and time constraints. Reviews all 20 logbooks when students return to campus, trying to evaluate 24 weeks of work in short time. Grades based on completeness, industry supervisor signatures, and apparent effort.

Pain points:
- No visibility into what students are actually doing for 6 months
- Can't tell if student is struggling until they return with completed logbook
- Spent N80,000 last session on site visits and only reached 3 organizations
- Some logbooks look suspiciously similar or have entries that seem backdated
- When I finally see the logbooks, it's too late to guide improvements
- 20 logbooks arriving same week creates grading bottleneck

Would they use this?
Absolutely, if industry supervisors actually participate. Remote monitoring would be game-changer - could catch issues early, provide guidance during training instead of after, and distribute grading workload across the session. Main concern is whether industry supervisors will take time to use it, since they're volunteers essentially.

Key quote:
"I feel like I'm grading ghost students. I assign them, they disappear for 6 months, then reappear with a logbook. I have no idea what really happened during those 24 weeks."

DECISION: GO

Reason:
Problems are real and well-documented: students lose irreplaceable work (paper logbooks), remote supervision is broken (geographic separation), institutional oversight is minimal (no digital records), manual processes don't scale (hundreds of students per session). Digital transformation aligns with educational sector trends. SIWES Unit needs modern solution to maintain quality while reducing administrative burden.

If GO, what's the MVP?
31 core features covering authentication (students, school supervisors, industry supervisors, admins), student workflow (dashboard, weekly entries, diagram upload, review requests, supervisor comments, week locking, PDF generation, profile management), industry supervisor workflow (dashboard, weekly comments, final comment, profile management), school supervisor workflow (dashboard, weekly review and comments, week locking, final comment, profile management), admin workflow (dashboard with stats, user management, session management, department/faculty management, organization management with bulk upload, student/supervisor management with bulk upload, assignment system, enrollment management).
