   - Target: >95% success rate
   - How to track: activity_logs table, Better Auth analytics

2. Weekly Entry Completion Rate
   - What: Students making 3+ entries per week
   - Why: Primary adoption indicator
   - Target: >80% of students
   - How to track: PostgreSQL query on weekly_entries

3. Magic Link Engagement
   - What: Industry supervisors clicking magic links and commenting
   - Why: Remote supervision validation
   - Target: >60% click rate, >40% comment completion
   - How to track: verification table, weekly_comments table

4. PDF Generation Usage
   - What: Students generating logbook PDFs
   - Why: Digital-to-physical workflow validation
   - Target: >70% by week 24
   - How to track: Bull MQ job completion logs

5. System Uptime
   - What: EC2 availability and performance
   - Why: Reliability requirement
   - Target: >99% uptime, <2s page load
   - How to track: PM2 monitoring, Nginx logs

BUSINESS METRICS:

- Users: Track active students/supervisors per session
- Retention: Student engagement week-over-week
- Completion: Students finishing 24-week logbook

VALIDATION THRESHOLDS:

After 30 days:
- Authentication success should be >90%
- Weekly entry completion should be >60%
- If not, interview users and identify friction points

After 90 days:
- All core metrics should meet targets
- If not, consider UX redesign or training materials

INSTRUMENTATION PLAN:

Track:
- User logins (success/failure by type)
- Weekly entry creation/updates
- Magic link sends/clicks/usage
- PDF generation requests
- Supervisor comments (weekly/final)
- Bulk upload success/failure
- System errors and downtime

Tool: PostgreSQL queries, PM2, Bull Board, LogTape

REVIEW CADENCE:

Daily (first 2 weeks): Auth success, system uptime, errors
Weekly: Entry completion, magic link engagement, supervisor activity
End of Session: PDF usage, overall adoption, long-term metrics
